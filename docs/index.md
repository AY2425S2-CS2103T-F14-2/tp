**HRelper** is a desktop Human Resource (HR) management application designed to streamline the way users manage employee contact and profile details. Built for efficiency and speed, HRelper combines the familiarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the power and precision of a Command Line Interface (CLI).
